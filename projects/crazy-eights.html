			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<p>
			This is a passion project I made before apply to graduate school. I made
			all the art, code, and designed the game. It isn't "completed," but hasn't been
			worked on in favor of other projects. Additional action items for this project are
			changing the sprites of enemy cards so you can't see what they're playing, implementing
			multiple enemies, adding animations and sounds, adding complexity to the enemy AI, and
			creating a mechanic where players and enemies can "cheat."
