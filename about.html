	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
	Hi! My name is Savannah Balistreri and I'm a current master's student at Rochester Institute of Technology for Game Design and Development. 
	I have my BS from Santa Clara University in Computer Science, with minors in creative writing and studio arts. I specialize in 
	Gameplay Programming and AI Programming, but can dabble in a little bit of everything. I am efficient in Unreal and Unity, and am currently
	learning Godot. I also can code in C++, C#, C, Java, HTML, and CSS. I never back down from a challenge, I love all things living and green, and I'm a massive goofball.
